I am a 3rd-year PhD candidate studying at <a href='https://www.monash.edu/'>Monash University</a>. 

In 2019, I graduated from <a href='https://www.bupt.edu.cn/'>Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications</a> with a bachelor's degree. Following that, I moved to <a href='https://www.monash.edu/'>Monash University</a> to begin my PhD studies. I expect to finish my PhD studies at the end of 2022.


My supervisors are <a href='http://lilicoding.github.io/'>Dr. Li Li</a> and <a href='https://sites.google.com/site/johncgrundy/'>Prof. John Grundy</a>. 
My research topic, Big Code Augmented Android App Development, seeks to learn from "big code" to handle various programming tasks such as automated API usage recommendation and program patching. See our lab pages for more information on <a href='https://www.monash.edu/it/humanise-lab'>HumaniSE Lab</a> and <a href='https://github.com/SMAT-Lab'>SMAT Lab</a>.


I am looking for a faculty position and here is my <a href='../assets/pdf/Yanjie_Zhao_newCV.pdf'>resume</a>. If you would like to reach me, please send an email to <a href="#">Yanjie.Zhao@monash.edu</a>.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.
